Hi there, my name is Dmitry Saveliev and I am a humble backend developer with ~~years of~~ _some_ experience with **Go** and **Ruby**, living in Berlin.<br />
Open source enthusiast, born again Linux user, lifelong learner.<br />
I am mostly interested in distributed systems, functional programming, DevOps, doing experiments with and repairing my Arch.<br />
Also, I speak at meetups **[from time to time](https://github.com/gettaxi/go-talks)**.

Currently, I work for **[Thirdhash](https://thirdhash.com/)** company, building the amazing decentralized payment system **[Unit-e](https://unit-e.io/)**.
